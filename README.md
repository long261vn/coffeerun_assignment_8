# coffeerun_assignment_8
CPSC 473 - Assignment 8

Section 2 due April 3. Section 1 due April 5.

In this assignment, you will finish the CoffeeRun app, complete a Programming Challenge, and modify the app to work with a new back-end.

Complete the following:

1. Work through Chapter 13 to connect CoffeeRun to a back-end service.
2. Complete the SIlver Challenge: Validating Against the Remote Server .

Note: Steps (3) through (6) may be completed either before or after working through Chapter 14.

3. From the command line, install the json-server tool with npm install -g json-server then switch to your coffeerun/ directory.
4. Download db.json from GitHub. Place it in your coffeerun/ directory, then start the server with json-server --port=3002 --watch db.json
5. Modify SERVER_URL in scripts/main.js to use http://localhost:3002/coffeeorders
6. Update scripts/remotedatastore.js as necessary to use the local json-server as CoffeeRunâ€™s new back end.

Note that you will need to make changes to the way that orders are created. These changes should not affect the rest of the code.
Hint: POST a new order and see how the newly-created order differs from the order currently stored in db.json .

7. Work through Chapter 14 to switch over to Promises and JQuery Deferred objects when storing data.
8. Push the contents of your coffeerun directory into a new public GitHub repository
